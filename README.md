# OpenCV-3.4-with-Python-3-tutorials
This is a beginner level documentation of OpenCV 3.4 use with python.

This is the beginner tutorial of Open-CV, with good documentation and commentary.

Some of the tips I learned during coding.

* Create the documentation of every learning and project. It will help you like recall weapon and boiler plate.
* Type code by yourself, instead of just viewing them, unless you are in intermediate form.
* Show case your projects. People will only see you, when you show them. They wont spend time searching and launching your project in your system
